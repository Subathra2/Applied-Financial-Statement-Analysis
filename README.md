The project titled “Jyothy Labs Ltd. – A Financial Analysis” presents an in-depth examination of the company’s financial performance over the past five years. Jyothy Labs Ltd., a notable player in India’s FMCG sector with brands such as Ujala, Maxo, Margo, Exo, and Henko, has shown consistent growth in revenue and profitability. The analysis highlights the company's sound financial health, reflected through healthy liquidity ratios, manageable debt levels, and stable profitability margins. Key financial indicators such as the current ratio, return on equity, and net profit margin suggest that the company maintains a balanced operational and financial structure. Although its margins and returns are moderate when compared with larger competitors, Jyothy Labs’ strong brand presence, diversified product portfolio, and strategic market positioning enable it to remain competitive. The project concludes that while Jyothy Labs may not be the fastest-growing firm in the sector, its consistent performance and stability make it a promising player in the long run.
